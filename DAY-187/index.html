        This is the field where the battle did not happen,
        where the unknown soldier did not die.
        This is the field where grass joined hands, 
        where no monument stands,
        and the only heroic thing is the sky.

        Birds fly here without any sound,
        unfolding their wings across the open.
        No people killed—or were killed—on this ground
        hallowed by neglect and an air so tame
        that people celebrate it by forgetting its name.

    <pre id ="second"  style="background-color: rgb(3, 162, 109); color:white"">
        
        Over hill, over dale,
        Thorough bush, thorough brier,
        Over park, over pale,
        Thorough flood, thorough fire!
        I do wander everywhere,
        Swifter than the moon's sphere;
        And I serve the Fairy Queen,
        To dew her orbs upon the green;
        The cowslips tall her pensioners be;
        In their gold coats spots you see;
        Those be rubies, fairy favours;
        In those freckles live their savours;
        I must go seek some dewdrops here,
        And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.

        Crabbed Age and Youth
        Cannot live together:
        Youth is full of pleasance,
        Age is full of care;
        Youth like summer morn,
        Age like winter weather;
        Youth like summer brave,
        Age like winter bare:
        Youth is full of sports,
        Age's breath is short,
        Youth is nimble, Age is lame:
        Youth is hot and bold,
        Age is weak and cold,
        Youth is wild, and Age is tame:-
        Age, I do abhor thee;
        Youth, I do adore thee;
        O! my Love, my Love is young!
        Age, I do defy thee-
        O sweet shepherd, hie thee,
        For methinks thou stay'st too long.

        Blow, blow, thou winter wind
        Thou art not so unkind
        As man's ingratitude;
        Thy tooth is not so keen,
        Because thou art not seen,
        Although thy breath be rude.
        
        Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
        Most friendship if feigning, most loving mere folly:
        Then heigh-ho, the holly!
        This life is most jolly.
        
        Freeze, freeze thou bitter sky,
        That does not bite so nigh
        As benefits forgot:
        Though thou the waters warp,
        Thy sting is not so sharp
        As a friend remembered not.
        Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
        Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
        Then heigh-ho, the holly!
        This life is most jolly.
