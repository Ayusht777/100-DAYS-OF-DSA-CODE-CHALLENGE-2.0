            Coastal Processes
            The coastal zone is that part of the land surface influenced by marine processes. It extends from the landward limit of tides, waves, and wind blown coastal dunes, and seaward to the point at which waves interact significantly with the seabed.The coastal zone is a dynamic part of the Earth's surface where both marine and atmospheric processes produce rocky coasts, as well as beaches and dunes, barriers and tidal inlets, and shape deltas. The atmospheric processes include temperature, precipitation, and winds, while the major marine processes are waves and tides, together with water temperature and salinity. The coast also supports rich ecosystems, including salt marshes, mangroves, seagrass, and coral reefs. The diverse coastal ecology is favored by the shallow waters, abundant sunlight, terrestrial and marine nutrients, tidal and wave flushing, and a range of habitat types.
            Waves — generation and types.

            Waves provide about half the energy to do work at the coast. Ocean waves are generated by wind blowing over the ocean surface. The stronger the wind, the longer it blows and the longer the fetch, or stretch of ocean over which it blows, the larger the waves (Figure 1). The world's greatest wave factories are in the zone of sub-polar lows centered on 40–60° N and S latitudes, the so-called roaring 40's and screaming 60's. The strong westerly winds produce the world's biggest waves which initially head west, and are deflected equatorward by the Coriolis effect, arriving from the northwest in the northern hemisphere and southwest in the southern hemisphere (Figure 2). Other major wave climates are the easterly waves produced by the expansive but moderate velocity northeast and southeast Trade winds — and lesser seasonal waves produced by the monsoons and even the polar easterlies, together with occasional hurricanes that can produce massive waves as well as storm surges.
            When waves are being generated they are called a sea and consist of short, steep, high, slower waves, which tend to topple over and break, and have a broad spectrum of direction. Once the wind stops blowing, and/or the waves leave the area of generation, they quickly transform into swell — lower, longer, faster and uniform in direction. Swell waves can theoretically travel around the world with minimal loss of energy, while in reality they eventually break on some distant shore.
            Waves are a form of potential energy that can be transported across hundreds to thousands of kilometers of ocean to be released as kinetic energy when they shoal and break. Waves are defined by their height (H) (trough to crest), length (L) (crest to crest) and period (T) (time between successive crests). The longer the period the longer and faster the waves, as wave length L=1.56 T, and wave velocity C = 1.56 T2. When waves enter shallow water their velocity is controlled by the water depth (d) such that C=√gd where g is the gravitational constant. For this reason waves slow down as they move towards the shore, with a 10 sec wave traveling at 56 km/hr (35 mph) in deep water slowed to 7 km/hr (4 mph) in 5 m water depth.
            Tides and tidal currents.

            Tides are produced by the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun acting on a rotating Earth. This pull produces a very slight bulge in the ocean, which we know as tide. The tides and the currents they generate are responsible for about 50% of the marine energy delivered to the coast. The major impact of tides is to shift the shoreline between high and low tide, and to generate tidal currents either parallel to the coast, or at tidal inlets and estuaries, currents flowing into the inlets and perpendicular to the coast (Figure 3).
            Tidal inlet at Merrimbula, Australia. Tidal currents ebb and flood though the narrow inlet moving marine sand from the beach into the inlet to form a deep tidal channel and shallow sandy tidal delta.

            Wind and currents.

            Winds blowing over the oceans are responsible for generating ocean waves. Nearer the coast they can generate local seas — they can move the ocean surface and generate locally wind driven currents which in places can result in upwelling and downwelling. Finally, when blowing over the beach, they can transport sand inland to build coastal sand dunes.

            Fluvial-deltaic systems.

            Fluvial systems deliver sediment to the coast where it is deposited in estuaries and deltas. Depending on their location, deltas are also acted on by waves, tides, and other currents, and shaped to suit the prevailing processes. Sediment can also be moved longshore to supply beach and barrier systems (Figure 4).
